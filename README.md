Building an R package for the age-depth modelling software clam by Maarten Blaauw

Clam (Blaauw, 2010; this version 2.2) was written to perform 'classic' age-depth modelling - prior to applying more sophisticated techniques such as Bayesian age-depth modelling.  The original clam files can be found on Maarten Blaauw's [clam webpage](http://chrono.qub.ac.uk/blaauw/clam.html).  This work represents an effort to put clam into a package so that it can work on any file, or on a set of vector data (or a `data.frame`), removing the necessity to have files in specific locations.

At this point this package does run, but it runs poorly.  I suggest that you wait until kinks have been worked out.
